## Hello there 👋  

My name is Luiz Romano, and I am a developer in training. I'm currently enrolled in a Full Stack development program, progressing through modules that build modern web applications. At the moment, I am diving into **JavaScript** to enhance my skills in creating dynamic and interactive solutions.  

I've always been curious about how technology works and its impact on our daily lives, which naturally led me to explore the world of development.  

## 🛠️ Technologies and Knowledge:  
- **HTML5 and CSS3:** Completed modules, applying best practices in modern and responsive layouts.  
- **Git and GitHub:** Studying version control and collaboration practices in projects.  
- **JavaScript and React (coming soon):** Preparing to deepen my understanding of dynamic and interactive interfaces.  
- **🐍 Python:** Basic knowledge of initial concepts. [Check out my Shopping List project](https://github.com/Luiz-Romano/grocerylist/blob/main/grocerylist).  
- **IT and Technical Support:** Hands-on experience with a solid foundation in logic, system implementation.  

## 💻 Tools:  
- **Development Tools:** VS Code, Figma, Azure DevOps.  

## 🚀 Ongoing Projects:
